                    <li>I started as a dishwasher here. The schedule was hectic, but I was meticulous in my
                        cleaning.
                        I wasn't making much money, so I informed my boss that I'd be looking for a new job.
                        They had been
                        so impressed by my work that they offered to promote me to a position as cook instead! I
                        was pretty
                        proud of that, because it was my first ever promotion and raise. I bring the same (okay,
                        probably more)
                        drive and passion to my programming.

                        can't overemphasize how I learned to handle stress, tight deadlines, and cleanliness.
                        Have you tried preparing a meal for 30 people in 4 hours? How about handling snack
                        requests
                        in the middle of it? Oh no! You only have enough meat for 5 people! And you need to keep
                        your
                        workstation clean and sanitized, avoiding cross-contamination. Yeah, I can handle
                        deadlines
                        while keeping my code clean and well-structured.</p></li>

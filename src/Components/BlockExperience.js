                            <li>I started as a dishwasher here. The schedule was hectic, but I was meticulous in my
                                cleaning.
                                I wasn't making much money, so I informed my boss that I'd be looking for a new job.
                                They had been
                                so impressed by my work that they offered to promote me to a position as cook instead! I
                                was pretty
                                proud of that, because it was my first ever promotion and raise. I bring the same (okay,
                                probably more)
                                drive and passion to my programming.

                            <li><p>Most of my responsibilities are not relevant to my current career path. However, I
                                can't overemphasize how I learned to handle stress, tight deadlines, and cleanliness.
                                Have you tried preparing a meal for 30 people in 4 hours? How about handling snack
                                requests
                                in the middle of it? Oh no! You only have enough meat for 5 people! And you need to keep
                                your
                                workstation clean and sanitized, avoiding cross-contamination. Yeah, I can handle
                                deadlines
                                while keeping my code clean and well-structured.</p></li>
